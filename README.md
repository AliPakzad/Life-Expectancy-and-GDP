# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
Codecademy Project


For this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you’ll be creating a blog post to share your findings on the World Health Organization website.

Example Project
Life Expectancy and GDP Example Project

Project Objectives:
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
- Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations
- Preprocess, explore, and analyze data
Prerequisites:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing
- Summarizing Quantitative Data
- Data Wrangling and Tidying
- Data Manipulation with Pandas
================================================================================


1. Setting up the Project
First we will have to download our data from Life Expectancy and GDP project and make sure our directory is set up for Jupyter notebook.

Hint:
Download the Life Expectancy and GDP project.
Double-click on it to “unzip” the folder. It should contain several items:
 all_data.csv
 life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb
In the command line, navigate into the unzipped file directory.
Type the following into the command line: jupyter notebook This should open a browser tab.
Click on life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb in the browser tab. This will open up your Jupyter Notebook.

2. Setting up your Git Repository
Create a new Git repository for this project.

Hint:
If you need more guidance, review the GitHub Desktop article as well as this Git cheat sheet.
Main components that you will want to include:
Jupyter Notebook
CSV file

3.Project Scoping:
Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

Hint:
Here is University of Chicago’s Data Science Project Scoping Guide.
Main components that you will want to include:

Goals
Data
Analysis

4.Load the Data
You have been given one CSV file, all_data.csv which contains data on GDP and life expectancy within different countries.

Hint:
Open all_data.csv with pandas.

The dataset provided has the following columns of data:

Country - nation
Year - the year for the observation
Life expectancy at birth (years) - life expectancy value in years
GDP - Gross Domestic Product in U.S. dollars
Read over the pandas read_csv documentation for a refresher on how to load and look at the dataset.

5.Explore and Explain Data
Once you have your data, it’s a good idea to get acquainted with it. You should show some summary statistics and visually examine your data. Don’t forget to write out some insights that you have gained along with your analysis.

Hint:
You can start to build graphs from the data by first importing Matplotlib or seaborn and then making some plots!

Some components that you may want to include:

Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
What is the average life expectancy in these nations?

6.Conclusions
Finally we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and findings.
Hint:
Main components that you will want to include:

What did you learn throughout the process?
Are the results what you expected?
What are the key findings and takeaways?
7.Create a Blog Post
Once you’ve performed your analysis, you’re ready to create your blog post.
Hint:
Create a blog post using Medium, or some other blogging platform.

Your blog post should include the following:

A compelling title about your findings
An introduction to the data research
A section sharing the background info (definition of GDP for example) and sources for your data as well as any further research you conducted
An accompanying paragraph describing the following visualizations
A conclusion touching on the limitations of the data
